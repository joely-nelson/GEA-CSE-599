This directory should contain the datasets used for training the model: `submission_format.csv  test_values.csv  train_labels.csv  train_values.csv`. Only train_*.csv are required, since the test have no labels and can't be used for training and the submission_format.csv is specific to the competition.

Data is only available to past participants of the competition so can't be freely downloaded.
